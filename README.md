# Hexagon
Hexagon, the original HexNet compatible game about making order or tearing it down.  
You assume the role of a user surfing the Hexagon, a huge complex mainframe.  
You collect lost data in the form of BITS, and then use them to assemble LOCAGONS (LOCations in the hexAGON) and build a house, hotel, teleporter station, bank, trap, store, toll road, factory, stronghold, club, etc...  
Use the COMPILER to create HACKS, which can be used to destroy, steal, plunder, and even delete other players.  
The open-world nature of Hexagon assures endless fun with friends. Hexagon works best with lots of players -- 15 or so is the optimum amount -- but see what happens when you get 30, or 40, or 50...? Can you maintain order, or will the world fall to the hackers?  

## How To Play
Hexagon features an integrated tutorial. Simply use in-game commands to read it.

## Setup
You will require somewhere to host the server (it runs on java) and as many players as you like. The game works best with ~6-12 players.  
From there, just run the server. The players then join in by running their HexNet programs, which are compatible with all Hexagon/HexNet java games by me, MillerHollinger. You will need the IP of the host.
